## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/CNYT-ECI/Complex-Numbers-Calculator
```
2. Build the artifact yourself using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or from your IntelliJ project import as a dependency the [jar](https://github.com/CNYT-ECI/Complex-Numbers-Calculator/blob/master/complex.jar) from **File/Project Structure/Project Settings/Modules/Dependencies/Add button/JARs or directories/thisProjectJarLocationInYourPC**

3. Thats it! now you can import all of my Complex Library classes.
